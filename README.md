# Applications of Data Storytelling Final Group Project ðŸ”¥
Group Members: Ethan Wong, Timmy Ren, Michael Crosson, Andy Ma, Jennifer Gonzalez

For this project, we decided to explore what patterns, clusters, and trends can be uncovered in Californiaâ€™s fire damage data when examining structural characteristics, geographic distributions, and incident details! Our intended audience includes community leaders and public safety advocates invested in understanding local risks and planning community resilience initiatives.
